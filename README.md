GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result gets added to his/her ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, then his/her ROUND score gets lost. If the player rolls two 6s in a row on a signle dice, then his/her GLOBAL score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his/her ROUND score gets added to his/her GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach _ points on the GLOBAL score wins the game
- The players can enter what final score they want
- If no score or 0 is entered, the default score will be 100
